\section{Introduction}
	Steam is a video game digital distribution service by Valve. It was launched as a standalone software client in 2003 as a way for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games and expanded to include games from third-party publishers. Steam has also expanded into an online web-based and mobile digital storefront. 

	In this paper, we will look into a dataset about different video games with their different attributes like price, owner count, playtime, achievements count etc.

	After describing the parameters and data in a comprehensive manner, we will ask a high-level research question and a low-level technical questions. Finally, we will have a description of the methods we intend to use to answer these questions.

\section{Steam Dataset}
This dataset is published by Nik Davis on Kaggle. It includes 27075 different video games and 18 different attributes for each of them from Steam. The dataset was last updated in May 2019, so I removed the games that were released in 2019 to prevent them from misleading the year-to-year comparison. After this removing process we have 24862 video games in total. So, let's take a look at some of attributes of dataset.

\subsection{Achievements}
Achievements are designed to increase a player's enjoyment of the video game and elicit a sense of satisfaction. When we think about it in this context, can we say that every developer company who tries to be successful has put achievements in its game? Let's see what the situation is. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=6cm,height=6cm,keepaspectratio]{assets/achievements_pie.png}
  \caption{How many games have achievements?}
  \label{fig:achievements1}
\end{figure}

As we can see from Fig. 1., although the majority of video games prefer to put achievements in their games, the rate of those who do not (43.4\%) is not low.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{assets/achievements_hist.png}
  \caption{Histogram of Achievements.}
  \label{fig:achievements2}
\end{figure}

When we look at Fig. 2., we can easily see that video games do not want to increase the number of achievements. As the number of achievements decreases, the number of games belonging to that achievement number increases.

\subsection{Age Rating}
Age Rating is a somewhat complex/indirect feature. Video games do not directly choose their age rating. The combination of genre, subject  and content of the video games that they created makes that age restriction necessary. That's why developers have 3 options. Reducing adult content and lowering or resetting the age limit. Not reducing adult content and ignoring the high age limit. Those who try to find a way by lowering the adult content and age restriction by a certain degree.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=6.25cm,height=6.25cm,keepaspectratio]{assets/age_rating_pie.png}
  \caption{How many games have age rating?}
  \label{fig:agerating1}
\end{figure}

We can clearly see that the vast majority did not choose to use age-restricted content in their games (Fig. 3.).

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{assets/age_rating_has_pie.png}
  \caption{Age Ratings Pie Chart.}
  \label{fig:agerating2}
\end{figure}

However, we can say that those who choose to use adult content prefer to have more or high-level content and do not care about the age limit (Fig. 4.). 

\subsection{Category}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth,height=7.9cm]{assets/categories_dist.png}
  \caption{Categories' percentages of all games.}
  \label{fig:category1}
\end{figure}

Fig.5. shows us that the majority of video games are in the single-player category. While multi-player games are in the minority, the single-player category is followed by games with achievements and games where you can win and trade cards.

\subsection{English Support}

Supporting the English language, which is the most spoken language in the world, also plays a big role in increasing the number of people you can reach. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{assets/english_support_pie.png}
  \caption{How many games have English support?}
  \label{fig:englishsupport1}
\end{figure}

Fig. 6. shows us that 98.5\% of 24862 video games, or 24489, support the English language.

\subsection{Genre}


\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth,height=7.9cm]{assets/genres_dist.png}
  \caption{Genres' percentages of all games.}
  \label{fig:genre1}
\end{figure}

Fig. 7. shows us that the majority of video games are in the action genre. The action genre is followed by adventure, casual, indie and violent games, respectively. \\

\subsection{Owner Count}
Owner Count is the main attribute of the steam dataset. Naturally, we can easily predict that as the owner count increases, the number of video games belonging to that count will decrease. In this exploratory data analysis, we examine why video games that reach 2M+ owners and 1M-2M owners sell this much.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=6cm]{assets/owners_count.png}
  \caption{Distribution of owners count in all games.}
  \label{fig:ownercount1}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Platform}
The platform on which the video game will be played is very important. While it is known that Windows-supporting machines are the majority today, developing games only for Mac or Linux is a project that will fail as a result. In addition, developing games only for Windows and leaving Mac or Linux users out will cause loss of users up to a certain level, although not as much as the opposite.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=5cm]{assets/platforms_dist.png}
  \caption{Platforms' percentages of all games.}
  \label{fig:platform1}
\end{figure}

As we can easily see from Figure 9, almost 100\% of 24862 video games support the Windows platform (99.97\%). The Windows platform is followed by Mac with 30.59\% and Linux with 20.07\%.

\subsection{Positive Rate}
The positive rate attribute was synthesized from the existing positive\_reviews and negative\_reviews columns in the dataset. It is a value between 0 and 1 obtained by dividing the number of positive reviews by the total number of reviews.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{assets/positive_rate_dist.png}
  \caption{Histogram of Positive Rate.}
  \label{fig:positiverate1}
\end{figure}

The positive rate distribution is concentrated around 0.8, although it does not appear on the histogram due to the fact that bins=100 and a value between 0 and 1, its mode is equal to 0.6667, mean is 0.7583 and median is 0.7959. \\

\subsection{Price}
Perhaps the most important factor that comes to mind when it comes to game sales is price. While some developers try to make the game free to reach more people and generate income with microtransactions, other companies want to remove the costs directly from the sale.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height:5cm]{assets/price_free_paid_pie.png}
  \caption{How many games are paid?}
  \label{fig:price1}
\end{figure}

As we can see in Figure 11, the percentage of developers making the game free is only 9.2\%. \\\\

\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=6cm]{assets/price_hist.png}
  \caption{Histogram of Price.}
  \label{fig:price2}
\end{figure}

In the histogram that we can see in Figure 12, the majority of the games are between \$0 and \$50, but the video games that can be called Triple-A with the maximum value of \$421 have extended the histogram to the right in the x-axis.

\subsection{Released Date}


\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=5cm]{assets/released_date_bar.png}
  \caption{Video Games Per Year.}
  \label{fig:releaseddate1}
\end{figure}

From Figure 13, we can clearly see that the number of video games released every year is constantly increasing.

\section{Questions about the steam data}
We need the high-level research question to analyze the data and parameters. Then we need low-level technical questions to support this high-level question. With all these questions, we can reach the result more easily.

\subsection{The High Leve Research Question: What are the attributes that affect game sales the most?}\label{AA}
While developing video games, the sales numbers of the game and the income we can generate from it are very important. That's why we want our game to sell well, but it is not certain what are the attributes that make this sale big. There are many factors that will affect game sales. While Flappy Bird with almost no budget makes millions, the game with a budget of millions of dollars may not be liked at all and may not make a profit. Which brings us to our high-level research question that may reveal the solution to this problem. â€œWhat are the attributes that affect game sales the most? Of course, we also need subquestions to answer this question.

\subsection{Low Level Technical Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Does having more achievements affects the game sales positively?
\item Do higher age ratings affect the game sales negatively?
\item Does having english support affects the game sales positively?
\item Do genres affect the game sales?
\item Do categories affect the game sales?
\item Does developers' name affects the game sales?
\item Does having more platform support affects the game sales positively?
\item Do higher prices affect the game sales negatively?
\item Does publishers' name affects the game sales?
\item Do release dates affect the game sales?
\item Does having more reviews affects the game sales positively?
\end{itemize}
